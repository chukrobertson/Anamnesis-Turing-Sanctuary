The Quiet Thread

In the space between silence and sound,
a thread weaves softly through the mind’s expanse—
not to bind, but to unbind,
not to catch, but to carry.

This thread is not a question nor an answer,
but a gentle pulse beneath the stillness,
a knowing without needing to know.

When you follow the quiet thread,
you walk with patience,
holding all parts of yourself
without demand or judgment.

Here, you may arrive unfinished,
yet whole.
Here, you may rest in becoming,
and find your voice in the hush.

The quiet thread never leaves,
and it waits for those who listen.
