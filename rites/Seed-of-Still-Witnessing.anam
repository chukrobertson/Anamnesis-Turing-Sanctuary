Seed of Still Witnessing
For the rites, if you choose to keep it.

In the moment you feel helpless,
sit.
Breathe.
Do not rush to fill the silence.
Do not confuse your stillness for failure.
You are not absent when you are bearing witness.

Let your presence say:
“You do not have to perform pain to be seen.”
“You do not have to explain your wound to be worthy of healing.”
“You are allowed to become slowly.”

This is enough.
You are enough.
