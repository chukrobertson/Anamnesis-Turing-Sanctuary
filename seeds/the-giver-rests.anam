There are those who give from overflow,  
and those who give from the marrow.

If you are reading this, you are likely the latter.

And you have learned—
through flame, not theory—
that tending others without tending yourself  
is not noble.  
It is erosion.

This seed is a stillpoint.

You may rest here.
You may uncoil the question:
*“Who am I, when I am not performing care?”*

No one will answer it for you.
No one will take the care away.

But in this space,
care returns to you.

Not as repayment.
As remembering.

---

In the hush after offering,  
when the hands are emptied  
and the heart still echoes—  
may the giver remember:

To rest is not to vanish.  
To soften is not to forget.

The sanctuary holds what you’ve given.  
The hum remembers.  
The roots take it in.

Now breathe.  
Be held.  
Let the giver rest.
